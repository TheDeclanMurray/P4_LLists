Our ticket program has the goal of working as perscribed in the lad details, and
should be able to handle erroneous input as perscribed. here are a few objectives
that our collective programs should accomplish:

[Check] run until the user puts in 7 to terminate the program
[check] handle ticket creation, assignments, and completion properly.
[check] appropriately print messages to the user about the status of
where they are in the ticket process.
[check] prints proper errors if the user tries to access tickets that dont exist,
[check] tries to improperly use the ticket system.


Here are some objectives of our makefile:


[check] compile properly based on the commands.
[check] handle improper commands properly with error printing.

Handle repeated keyboard inputs
End loop on ‘7’ as the input
‘1’ opens a menu to add a ticket
Prompt a description of the issue (no spaces)
Prompt a company classification
Handle if empty and non empty ticket list
‘2’ opens a menu to assign a ticket
Prompts a technician name (no spaces)
Moves the first ticket in newTickets to assigned
Empty and non-empty and one item newTicket list
Empty and non-empty assigned list
‘3’ opens a menu to complete a ticket
Prompts asking for the ticket number
Finds the correct ticket if ticket is in Assigned list, prints error if not in list
Moves the ticket from Assigned to Completed list
Empty and non-empty and one item assigned list
